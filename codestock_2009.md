David Silverlight

The Silverlight Group

Microsoft MVP

David Silverlight is an independent software developer with deep knowledge of XML and Microsoft’s .NET. An avid teacher and evangelist, he created XMLPitstop.com as a resource for other developers.

While the availability of examples is impressive, David actually takes things one step further in his in-person technical presentations at conferences and events such as Microsoft Developer Days. His favorite approach is to spend time going through the code for the demo applications he creates for XMLpitstop.com, giving developers the opportunity to learn firsthand the principles behind their creation. “It’s like a chef’s cooking show on TV,” says David. “I present the general technique, and spend time on anything that’s tricky. Just as a cook would then turn to the full recipe, developers who have participated in my presentation can refer to the demos they download, with greater knowledge of how they were built.”
